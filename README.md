This repository have tasks given by CODSOFT Internship

PROJECT 1: TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION

In this project, I tackled the challenge of predicting passenger survival on the Titanic. I utilized the Titanic dataset obtained from the Kaggle website, following Codsoft's project instructions. Employing Python and the Scikit-Learn library, I implemented a Logistic Regression model. This model forecasts whether a passenger survived or not by acting as a binary classification tool trained using Logistic Regression.

PROJECT 2: MOVIE RATING PREDICTION WITH PYTHON

In this project, I built a model to predict movie ratings using the IMDB dataset from Kaggle. This project involved implementing Linear Regression as the prediction technique. First, we processed the data and visualized it with various charts for analysis. Then, we performed feature engineering to prepare the data for the model. Finally, we evaluated the model's performance using evaluation metrics.

PROJECT 3:IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION

In this project, I built a machine learning model to predict the category of Iris flowers. I used a dataset downloaded from the Kaggle website, following Codsoft's instructions. In this project, I implemented multiple classification algorithms using Python and Scikit-Learn. The model's accuracy was calculated and established with the aid of evaluation metrics. Through this process, I discovered that the Random Forest Classifier algorithm exhibited higher performance efficiency in training. However, the Logistic Regression model achieved better accuracy in both the training and test data.
